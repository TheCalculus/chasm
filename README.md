## Introduction

A toy-project meant to mimic basic functionality of React and other web frameworks.
I don't see it being used professionally, just because C isn't really a well suited language for this purpose.

## Installation

Using chasm (at its current stage) is exceptionally easy. 
It is currently not possible to run the `build_run.sh` bash script, as the `build` directory is not in the repo.
When `chasm` is ready to be "used," run the following in your terminal.

```bash
# cd to chasm root
$ sh build_run.sh
```
