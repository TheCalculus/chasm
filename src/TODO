# FEATURES
status | description | identifier

[ ] implement webassembly support for client-side execution of c code
[ ] make server multithreaded and more robust to support more than one user securely 
    (or use a library to do this)
[ ] remove reliance on tokenizer elements (Token) in templator_parlex.c

# BUGS
status | title | identifier

[.] error occuring somewhere after calling parse (chasm.c), looking at stack trace (1)
    must i say more?
        chasm(30344,0x1e1445e00) malloc: *** error for object 0x1e144e5a0: pointer being realloc'd was not allocated
        chasm(30344,0x1e1445e00) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
        build_run.sh: line 15: 30344 Abort trap: 6           ./chasm

[ ] bug where iterateTokens reads values incorrectly and tokens as (null) but only within a few iterations (2)
    resolve iterateTokens bug where tokens are not being correctly outputted. 
    probably an issue related to memory.

[ ] segmentation fault occuring potentially after resizing node->attributes (3)
        node->attributes (char**) resized to 10
        'li' == 'li' (end tag found)
        node->attributes (char**) resized to 10
        Token* resized to 125
        'li' == 'li' (end tag found)
        node->attributes (char**) resized to 15
        build_run.sh: line 14: 31411 Segmentation fault: 11  ./chasm
