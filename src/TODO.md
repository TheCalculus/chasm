# FEATURES  
status | description | identifier  

- [ ] implement webassembly support for client-side execution of c code  
- [ ] make server multithreaded and more robust to support more than one user securely (or use a library to do this)  
- [ ] make it possible for chasm to work with any server (it just needs to be told when and where changes occur)
- [ ] remove reliance on tokenizer elements (Token) in templator_parlex.c  
- [ ] write parser `nodetree to HTML` converter
- [ ] implement reactivity and functionality to update only nodes that are directly effected by a change
- [ ] remove hash function from tokenizer in `templator_parlex.c`

# BUGS
status | title | identifier  

- [x] error occuring somewhere after calling parse (chasm.c), looking at stack trace (1)  
    ``` 
        chasm(30344,0x1e1445e00) malloc: *** error for object 0x1e144e5a0: pointer being realloc'd was not allocated  
        chasm(30344,0x1e1445e00) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug  
        build_run.sh: line 15: 30344 Abort trap: 6           ./chasm  
    ```

- [x] segmentation fault occuring potentially after resizing node->attributes (3)  
    ```
        node->attributes (char**) resized to 10  
        'li' == 'li' (end tag found)  
        node->attributes (char**) resized to 10  
        Token* resized to 125  
        'li' == 'li' (end tag found)  
        node->attributes (char**) resized to 15  
        build_run.sh: line 14: 31411 Segmentation fault: 11  ./chasm  
    ```
- [ ] parseTreeToHTML not iterating through node sequence correctly (4)
    read #4 in BUGS.md
- [ ] bug where iterateTokens reads values incorrectly and tokens as (null) but only within a few iterations (2)  
    resolve iterateTokens bug where tokens are not being correctly outputted.   
    probably an issue related to memory.  
- [ ] go through code analysis and fix potential bugs, perhaps implement optimizations

Analysis of the provided code
Possible Bugs

The first possible bug in the code is that the lexer and parser variables are not declared or defined before they are used in the prepare_input function. This will result in a compilation error. To fix this, the lexer and parser variables should be declared and defined before using them. For example:

   Lexer* lexer;
   Parser* parser;


The second possible bug is that the lexer and parser variables are allocated memory using malloc, but they are not freed at the end of the prepare_input function. This will result in a memory leak. To fix this, the memory allocated for lexer and parser should be freed using free at the end of the function. For example:

   free(lexer);
   free(parser);


The third possible bug is that the lexer->buffer file is opened using fopen, but it is not closed using fclose after it is no longer needed. This will result in a resource leak. To fix this, the lexer->buffer file should be closed using fclose before returning from the function. For example:

   fclose(lexer->buffer);

Possible Optimizations

The generateNodeTree function uses a while loop to read characters from the lexer->buffer file until the end of the file is reached. Instead of reading characters one by one, it would be more efficient to read the entire file into a buffer and process it. This can be done using functions like fread and fgets.
The generateNodeTree function uses a switch statement to handle different characters. Instead of using a switch statement, a more modular approach would be to define separate functions for handling each character case. This would make the code more readable and maintainable.

Additional Room for Improvement

The code lacks proper error handling and error messages. It would be beneficial to add error handling mechanisms, such as returning error codes or using exceptions, and providing meaningful error messages to help identify and fix issues.
The code could benefit from better code organization and modularization. Breaking down the code into smaller functions with clear responsibilities would improve readability and maintainability.

Summary
In summary, the provided code has several possible bugs related to variable declaration, memory management, and resource leaks. There are also opportunities for optimization and improvement in terms of code structure, error handling, and modularity.
Please note that the analysis provided is based on a static analysis of the code and may not cover all possible bugs or optimizations. It is recommended to thoroughly test and review the code to identify and address any additional issues.
